Install via Composer (recommended)
The installation instructions described here are a short summary, you may want to check the Definitive Guide for more detailed instructions.

Choose one of the application templates to start installing Yii 2.0. An application template is a package that contains a skeleton Web application written in Yii which you can start building your application from. If you just start with Yii, we recommend the installation of the basic template.

To install the basic application template, run the following command:

php composer.phar create-project yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic

The best way to get started with the basic application template is to follow the introduction in the definitive guide.

To install the advanced application template, run the following command:

php composer.phar create-project yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced advanced


php composer.phar update yiisoft/yii2 yiisoft/yii2-composer bower-asset/jquery.inputmask
